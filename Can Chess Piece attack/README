This piece of code creates a linked list of when reading an input line from a file.
First it checks if there's a chess piece at given position, if no print out a - in the output file.
If there is a chess piece in the position, print out the letter of the chess piece in the output file and check if it's attacking other pieces.
If it is attacking, print y, if not print n.
Move on to the next line and create new linked list and repeated above steps.
I got some code from Sesh's notes, specifically the insert() and traverse() in the linked list.
I didn't use traverse() to run the code, it's more like a debugging method to check where went wrong.
