ChessMove actually moves chess pieces on the board which turns out is exponentially harder than just see if it's attacking other pieces.
Used crap ton of if statements and some externally help on ideas where my code went wrong. Also crap ton of System output just to debug where the frick-frack-snick-snack my code went wrong.
Also had an entire bottle of Yerba Mate just to keep me going on working this assignment.
